Full-featured Home Assistant integration for [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net). Monitor folder sync status, device connectivity and traffic, trigger rescans, and pause/resume folders and devices — all from your HA dashboard. Supports multiple Syncthing instances simultaneously.

## Why this instead of the built-in integration?

The core Syncthing integration creates only one sensor per folder showing its state. That's it.

This integration adds:

| Feature | Built-in | This |
|---------|----------|------|
| Folder state sensor | ✅ | ✅ |
| Folder completion % | ⚠️ attr only | ✅ dedicated sensor |
| Bytes / files needed | ⚠️ attr only | ✅ dedicated sensor |
| Folder size & file count | ⚠️ attr only | ✅ dedicated sensor |
| Pull error detection | ⚠️ attr only | ✅ dedicated sensor |
| Last scan / last file | ❌ | ✅ |
| Device online/offline | ❌ | ✅ |
| Device connection type | ❌ | ✅ |
| Per-device traffic stats | ❌ | ✅ |
| Total traffic sensors | ❌ | ✅ |
| Scan trigger (button + service) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Pause / resume folder | ❌ | ✅ |
| Pause / resume device | ❌ | ✅ |
| Multi-instance support | ❌ | ✅ |
| UI config (no YAML) | ✅ | ✅ |

## Screenshots

**System device** — version, uptime, running state, total traffic and scan button:

**Folder** — sync state, completion, controls and all folder sensors:

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS → Integrations
2. Click the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/Csontikka/ha-syncthing-extended` with category **Integration**
4. Click **Download**
5. Restart Home Assistant

After setup, the integration appears in Settings → Integrations:

![Integration card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Csontikka/ha-syncthing-extended/master/images/integration_card_v015.png)

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/syncthing_extended/` to your HA `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Add Integration**
2. Search for **Syncthing**
3. Enter your connection details:

![Config flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Csontikka/ha-syncthing-extended/master/images/config_flow.png)

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Host | Yes | — | IP address or hostname of the Syncthing instance |
| Port | Yes | `8384` | Syncthing GUI/API port |
| API Key | Yes | — | Found in Syncthing UI: Actions → Settings → API Key |
| Use HTTPS | No | `false` | Connect using HTTPS instead of HTTP |
| Verify SSL | No | `false` | Validate the HTTPS certificate (requires Use HTTPS) |
| Update interval | No | `30` | How often to poll for updates, in seconds (10–300) |

### Finding your API key

![Syncthing API key location](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Csontikka/ha-syncthing-extended/master/images/syncthing_settings_apikey.png)

- **Syncthing UI**: Actions → Settings → right panel → API Key
- **Linux**: `~/.local/state/syncthing/config.xml` → `<gui><apikey>…</apikey></gui>`
- **Proxmox LXC**: `/root/.local/state/syncthing/config.xml`

### Remote access requirement

Syncthing must listen on a non-localhost address. If bound to `127.0.0.1:8384`, change it to `0.0.0.0:8384` in Syncthing GUI (Settings → GUI Listen Addresses) and restart Syncthing.

### Options

After setup you can change the **Update interval** via **Settings → Integrations → Syncthing → Configure**.

### Re-authentication

If your API key changes, Home Assistant will show a re-authentication prompt. Click **Re-authenticate** and enter the new API key — no need to delete and re-add the integration.

### Example automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Alert when Syncthing folder has errors"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.syncthing_extended_folder_documents_error
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Syncthing: Documents folder has sync errors!"

  - alias: "Scan after backup completes"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.backup_status
        to: "completed"
    action:
      - service: syncthing_extended.scan_all

  - alias: "Alert when device offline for 1 hour"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.syncthing_extended_device_nas_connected
        to: "off"
        for: "01:00:00"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Syncthing: NAS has been offline for 1 hour"
```

## Performance & Database Tips

This integration creates many entities per folder and device. If you notice increased database size, we recommend the following:

### Disable unused entities

We recommend disabling entities you don't actively use:
**Settings → Devices & Services → Syncthing** → click the device → find the entity → toggle it off.
Disabled entities are not polled and generate no history.

### Exclude from recorder

High-frequency numeric sensors (traffic counters, uptime, bytes needed) can accumulate a lot of history. If you only need the current values and don't require historical data, we recommend excluding them from the recorder in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
recorder:
  exclude:
    entity_globs:
      - sensor.syncthing_extended_*_in_bytes
      - sensor.syncthing_extended_*_out_bytes
      - sensor.syncthing_extended_*_uptime
      - sensor.syncthing_extended_*_bytes_needed
```

Or exclude the entire integration and re-include only what you want to track:

```yaml
recorder:
  exclude:
    entity_globs:
      - sensor.syncthing_extended_*
      - binary_sensor.syncthing_extended_*
  include:
    entity_globs:
      - binary_sensor.syncthing_extended_*_running
      - binary_sensor.syncthing_extended_*_error
      - sensor.syncthing_extended_*_state
```

## Troubleshooting

### Diagnostics Export

Download the integration diagnostics file for bug reports — it includes integration state and the last 1000 debug log entries.

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Find **Syncthing** → click the integration
3. Click the **three-dot menu** → **Download diagnostics**
4. Attach the `.json` file to your [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Csontikka/ha-syncthing-extended/issues)

### Debug Logs

To see detailed logs in the HA log viewer, add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.syncthing_extended: debug
```

This enables per-request API traces, coordinator update summaries, and button/service call tracking.

## Removal

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Syncthing**
2. Click the three-dot menu → **Delete**
3. Optionally remove `custom_components/syncthing_extended/` and restart HA
